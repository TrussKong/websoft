<h1>My report page in the course Software Development for the Web DA377B</h1>

<p><img src="img/thats_me.jpg" width="300" alt="Me on an image" class="centerImg"></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is Daniel Truss Kongdet, my middle name is actually derives from Thai culture. In Thailand most names are quite difficult, therefore one is given a shorter and easier name also known as a nickname. However, my name was not difficult but because of tradition I still got a Thai nickname. With that being said I am half Thai and half Mexican; born in USA California, Los Angeles. Growing up multcultural I was fortunate enough to learn 3 languages and have amazing food from both cultures. Furthermore, from being brought up in such a diverse background I spent most of my childhood moving between USA, Mexico, and Thailand. Thus, I was exposed different lifestyles, that gave me the abiltity to adapt to new surrrondings fast. This lifestyle utimately lead for me to love traveling and being very social wanting to always make new friends. </p>

<p> Other than traveling and meeting people my hobbies consist of being active. I enjoy playing basketball, American football, rollerblading, skatebording, and biking. However, as I got older I have lessened sport activities and focused more on going to the gym and doing weight training and condiditoning. </p>

<p>Keep it real! </p>
