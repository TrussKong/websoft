<h1>A report from the course Software Development for the Web DA377B</h1>

<h2>S01</h2>
<p>I did have prior experience in Git version control; however, I primarily 
    used github GUI or the built in tool inside of intelliJ. So my experience 
    before was not through command line because I tried to avoid it as much as
     possible as I was uneasy about it. But doing this assignment I tried to 
     use the command line more as it was recommended by my instructor and now 
     I believe I’m more comfortable with the command line. So explained before 
     I used github so I am familiar with it; however, it was more with Java 
     and not with markdown as I had no previous experience with markdown. 
     Also this assignment was my first time using Github pages. Speaking of 
     new experiences this was also my first time creating a website. I have 
     never created one before so I can say I don’t have a knowledge of Web 
     development and I’m excited for this course to finally get the chance to 
     acquire the skill that is so prevalent in today's world. Well TIL learned 
     a new development environment Visual Studio Code my choice at the moment 
     for a text editor. I’m becoming more familiar with git command line. 
     Lastly to launch my own website through git pages are all the things I 
     learned during this assignment. </p>

<p>I have never previously experienced HTML, CSS or JavaScript before this course. Although,
    I'm very aware how widely used the languages are in the Web I have solely been doing Java
    but I am really intrigued to learn it this term. Initially before any previous knowledge
    programming I didn't know that there was a difference between Java and JavaScript, I honestly
    thought it was the same language and maybe people would pronounce it differently. But it is obvious
    now that there is a significant difference.
    While learning more about Web development one can see the roles and importance that HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript has this paradigm. HTML which is known as a hypertext markup language, is in essence partially
    what the name indicates; text, written text that could be content of the webpage in the form of a
    document to be displayed. However, in order for this document on the web to have some visual appeal
    this task can be assisted by Cascading Style Sheets abbreviated as CSS which is responsible for attributes
    such as, background color, layout, visual effects, font size as it focuses more on style than content.
    However, this creates a more static web application or website and in order to develop something more
    dynamically this is where one might consider JavaScript. AS JS is known as a high-level dynamic interpreted
    programming language. Moreover, it allows functions such as, bringing motion and logic to the website.
    As we know HTTP in a hypertext transfer protocol and enables HTML to interact with a web server with
    request-response protocol. The web server will have resources that allows the client to get new resources,
    add, delete, or update just to name a few allowing the website to display dynamic content.
    The thing I learned during this section was the architecture of how files in websites are structured
    in a text editor. Moreover, I'm leaning a great deal about how to navigate and utilize Visual Studio Code to
    develop web page content. In addition, styling in CSS as its still new to me learning how to manipulate
    web page content to look acceptable. I still have a lot to learn at least I'm learning some fundamentals.
