        <p class="reportPara">I did have prior experience in Git version control; however, I primarily 
            used github GUI or the built in tool inside of intelliJ. So my experience 
            before was not through command line because I tried to avoid it as much as
             possible as I was uneasy about it. But doing this assignment I tried to 
             use the command line more as it was recommended by my instructor and now 
             I believe I’m more comfortable with the command line. So explained before 
             I used github so I am familiar with it; however, it was more with Java 
             and not with markdown as I had no previous experience with markdown. 
             Also this assignment was my first time using Github pages. Speaking of 
             new experiences this was also my first time creating a website. I have 
             never created one before so I can say I don’t have a knowledge of Web 
             development and I’m excited for this course to finally get the chance to 
             acquire the skill that is so prevalent in today's world. Well TIL learned 
             a new development environment Visual Studio Code my choice at the moment 
             for a text editor. I’m becoming more familiar with git command line. 
             Lastly to launch my own website through git pages are all the things I 
             learned during this assignment. </p>

    <p class="reportPara">I have never previously experienced HTML, CSS or JavaScript before this course. Although,
        I'm very aware how widely used the languages are in the Web I have solely been doing Java
        but I am really intrigued to learn it this term. Initially before any previous knowledge
        programming I didn't know that there was a difference between Java and JavaScript, I honestly
        thought it was the same language and maybe people would pronounce it differently. But it is obvious
        now that there is a significant difference.
        While learning more about Web development one can see the roles and importance that HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript has this paradigm. HTML which is known as a hypertext markup language, is in essence partially
        what the name indicates; text, written text that could be content of the webpage in the form of a
        document to be displayed. However, in order for this document on the web to have some visual appeal
        this task can be assisted by Cascading Style Sheets abbreviated as CSS which is responsible for attributes
        such as, background color, layout, visual effects, font size as it focuses more on style than content.
        However, this creates a more static web application or website and in order to develop something more
        dynamically this is where one might consider JavaScript. AS JS is known as a high-level dynamic interpreted
        programming language. Moreover, it allows functions such as, bringing motion and logic to the website.
        As we know HTTP in a hypertext transfer protocol and enables HTML to interact with a web server with
        request-response protocol. The web server will have resources that allows the client to get new resources,
        add, delete, or update just to name a few allowing the website to display dynamic content.
        The thing I learned during this section was the architecture of how files in websites are structured
        in a text editor. Moreover, I'm leaning a great deal about how to navigate and utilize Visual Studio Code to
        develop web page content. In addition, styling in CSS as its still new to me learning how to manipulate
        web page content to look acceptable. I still have a lot to learn at least I'm learning some fundamentals.

    <p class="reportPara">As I stated in previous assignments it was my first time ever using JavaScript periods; 
        Therefore, during the assignment it was also my first time experiencing working with client 
        side JavaScript since everything is new to me in Web development. The only other language 
        I can compare to with JavaScript is Java since that is the only other programming language 
        that I have used during my studies at the University. Thus, far I can say there are a lot of
        similarities between the two languages. Some of the syntax and structure seems very similar
        and wasn’t so much of a learning curve as data structure seems to be the same and functions
        being called seem to be easy as well. The challenge for me was more about how the files 
        were structured such as how CSS, HTML, and JS files interacted with one another. However,
            once I learned how they all communicated with one another development became a bit easier.
            While working on the coding exercises I just always take a task at a time and depending 
            how much of a challenge the exercise was I would proceed to the next one as once engaged
            it's easier to continue and want to finish the next task. However, If I got stuck for 
            too long then I would decide maybe to move on  or come back to it later.  However, once
            done I would be very pleased with myself with what I had accomplished. But sometimes I
            was uncertain if I had met the criteria of the task. Reading the instructions it seems 
            to me that I had done the exercise correctly but of course there is always room for 
            improvement. Today I learned how to write in Javascript and how they make web pages more
                dynamic. As I stated before I learned how html, CSS, and JS all come together to create
                web content. Although I had learned CSS/html on the previous assignment, I found myself
                to learn much more about how to create elements and style them to more “advance” styles
                that are not just color and size. I did notice that my page is looking a little bit more
                    like a web page but I can also tell that I still need a lot more practice.

<p class="reportPara">During this assignment  I was presented with the task of building a web application using Node and Express. This was a surprise to me as my previous knowledge of JavaScript was that it was a front-end language, thus, I didn’t know that JS had a backside-language that could be done on the server-side of an web application. This was my first time using both node.js and express and the only comparable language I could relate it to is Java and that is probably because my arsenal of programming languages are limited to only that. Now that I have been working with Javascript for a few assignments now I’m getting a better understanding of syntax and feeling more confident, however, I can tell I still have lots of room for improvement such things as Node documentation helped out a lot with that. As for Node running and working with command line was still new to me and after the assignments I have found my development in the terminal getting better. The biggest challenge was understanding how to create functions, modules, and classes in files. Since it was a different structure than what I was used to compared to Java. Express seemed very similar to creating a RESTFUL API in Java with the same CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. With express I learned how to import and export functions and modules and how to create static resources. The method I used to do the coding assignment was follow the instructions and do each task one at a time in chronological order to have a good understanding. The instructions were pretty clear to comprehend if I ran into a problem I would resort to googling the question in order to overcome the problem I had. This method would work all the time as googling stuff doesn’t always have the direct answer, sometimes it would take a few attempts but ultimately would work. I aimed to get a 4 but at times I could find myself getting stuck and I found the task challenging . The lesson I learned during the assignment was the obvious working with NOde.js and Express such as creating classes, functions, and modules. In addition how to import and export these things from one file to another when needed.

    <p class="reportPara">So this was definitely the first time I ever worked with the server side language PHP and I found myself not liking the language maybe just because I felt like I couldn't do simple things like print in the web just to name a small thing. Thus, made my process slow however, with the lectures and example did help. But I would have to say maybe if I had worked with the language longer I could grow to like it as there are some similarities to java. However, with that being said I don’t think I would want to work with it again as I feel Javascript can do everything php can but better from my short experience with working with them. THus , I would say that Javascript and PHP are comparable. As always I at least try to aim for a 4 however, I didn’t want to work with PHP and just wanted to move on therefore, I didn’t go for another grade and was satisfied with just completing the first task. This was probably also due to the fact that I had so many challenges setting up the XAMMP web server and when I finally got the server to work I think my energy had dropped significantly. What I learned from this assignment was first of all the language PHP and working with the database. I felt like it has been a while since I have used MySQL so I could say that I learned SQL all over again as I felt like I had forgotten everything. So it was a great refresher. But it might have felt new as before when I worked with MySQL I would use workbench and I don’t think I would have to make so many query statements and the interface was easy to just drag and drop style. During this assignment the combination of separating PHP and html files structure was new so it was interesting ot learn how to require files from other locations such as the Header.php and footer.php we had to implement. </p>

    <p class="reportPara">Some of the charts have conflicting rankings of languages I guess it depends on what metrics you measure them and compare them in order to deem one better than another. In one of the articles it has JavaScript as the #1 spot and I don’t find that surprising at all as it used everywhere in web development so I can understand the need for it. However, I think where the language really excels is because JS used to be limited to only client side, however, a push to be able to fully develop everything in JS from back to front side development has made its popularity catapulted over other competitors I believe. I just found out during this course the term in the field of mean-stack developer and I think this could be the future and Javascript won’t go anywhere because of these advancements. I also believe that Swift will have a presence in the development world for a long time too because it's the official language of Apple and that is probably why you see that objective-C is in the decline fast. Big companies definitely play a big role when the longevity of the language is at question. FOr instance, there is a big trend going up in Go as it's Google's language. Another mention is Kotlin as it's now the language of Android App development.  OTher than that I don’t think I was surprised to see the top languages to be Java, Python, Javascript, C++, C, .net , as all articles mostly have these at the top but ranked slightly differently. But after all that being said other than JavaScript as I mentioned being able to do all aspects of development with only one language it is different as a perk and I would like to further learn this language more. But another strong case for the future language would have to be Python. As it seems to be a popular entry language that does so much with easy understandable and readable syntax. In addition the language is high in Machine learning and one of the biggest open source frameworks is TensorFlow one can understand that it's longest ivey in the tech world is strong. Therefore, I would have to recommend to my future employer that either JavaScript, Node.js. Express, React native, Redux and followed by Pythons, and learning tensorflow. Although PHP is one of the biggest frameworks I just personally would prefer the other choices I made. According to Google trends I compared PHP to JS by states In USA and JS was voted by every single state. However, internationally PHP had the slight edge but it was close. But because America sets the standard I hold the US compares with more weight since internationally it was close.

    <p class="reportPara">During this assignment we were asked to work with ASP.NET and C# programming language. The language I would have to say is very close to Java programming as its object-oriented and class based. However, the man defence is the how C# is component oriented. Furthermore, it seems to be more geared and easily to make web applications using frameworks such as ASP.NET CORE. But the syntax of both languages seem very familiar. However, first thing I noticed while compiling code on C# was how much more strict it was compared to Java as you could still run the program with bugs and C# would throw exceptions at much higher rate and would not compile unless fixed it seemed. During the exercise while making the console application was fairly easy as it felt like making an application like Java. However, while making the web application I found myself having much more difficult time. The framework used to build was MVC meaning Model, View, and Controller. These are components that are split up in order to make things more simple to debug and keep things organized. According to the Microsoft documentation this is the ideal way to make a web application. The other option I loosely used was Razor pages. .NET can be comparable to Node.js and Express we have used earlier during the course. Creating API’s to fetch data from Json seemed familiar and importing models by making components can be comparable. It was very challenging learning a new way of structure and the MVC pattern gave me a difficult time. I don’t know what I was doing wrong but I had such trouble getting  Json response from the creating an API to fetch the data using the controller. I prolly spent too much time trying to debug my issue to make it work.While working on the assignment I spent a lot of time reading documentation to understand how everything worked. However, it was a lot to grasp in such a short time. However, this has taught me that learning a new language is much faster than learning your first language. As you can bypass a lot of fundamentals and just understand concepts of libraries and dependencies. Especially how to read exceptions and google your answers. Furthermore, I spent a good time watching the lectures and reading the examples to tackle the task as they were similar. I believe I spent too much time reading and getting stuck at a problem that I just wanted to aim for and get a 3 during this exercise. But from the task there was a lot to take away from as I mentioned before its faster to learn a new language and I learned how to build a web app with .NET.

    <p class="reportPara">I was the only person to partake in writing the assignment of analyse performance of websites. The websites I have chosen to analyze are 3 of the same type of websites. The website are all News sites one being ESPN sports news, TechCrunch Tech news, and CNN Global news websites. While using google chrome using both built in dev-tools such as, lighthouse and network tab. First site I analyzed was espn using the network tab. The read I saw was 156 requests, 3.7 MB transferred, 12.8 MB resource, finished 1.6 min, DOMContentloaded 7.34s, and load: 22.11s. The biggest files I would observe were xhr files, in which area is an API known as XMLhttpRequest. The time was recorded at 878 ms and another at 882. However they were the slowest but the file sizes differed aas one was 872 B and the other was 91 KB. Next analysis was done with lighthouse and I discovered surprisingly how terrible the performance score at 3 it had. ESPN passed 10 audits. I would have thought it would be really good as ESPN is one of the top sports new sites in the world. The biggest suggestions are to Properly size images that would save them 12.43 s. Followed by eliminating render-blocking resources at 2.36. That is a huge discrepancy between the two. Third party code is hurting performance and should reduce that. Their SEO scored that highest at 91. Next I analyzed CNN news. The first and most notable analysis was the finish time compared to ESPN was 1.6 min to CNN’s 32.7 min. Another site that performance was low and I was surprised by that as well even worse than ESPN at 0. The opportunities that were suggested were preload key requests that would save 10.14 s. Followed by preconnect to required origins. CNN passed 12 audits compared to ESPN 10 audits. Both accessibility and best practices scored higher than ESPN but not by much. But search engine ranking SEO was just as high as ESPN at 91 points. Lastly I analysed TechCrunch the tech new site. The most notable thing in the network tab was it had about 30% less request than ESPN and CNN. The performance to all the sites were bad TechCrunch scored a 3 making CNN the worst of the 3. Some of the opportunities suggested were to eliminate render-blocking resources the same as ESPN. Also Reduce JavaScript execution time at 26.6. The passed 12 audits same as CNN.  After final inspection TechCrunch seem to have the best all around score which comes at a shocking surprise. With having the lowest request and best performing times in most categories.

<div class="content">
    <p class="reportPara">One of the Web Security protecting sensitive data must always be a concern whenever using any type of services on the web. ONe that always concerns me is Sensitive Data exposure using trusted websites to have proper encryption. Because vulnerabilities like man-in-the-middle can occur to sensitive data. For instance, your password. It may not mean a big deal to some but for those who use their passwords on all other websites, which I admit I used to do before then an attacker can access anything linked to your email almost. However, I don’t think one has to worry about these issues with big companies as they would proll protist consumers protections. But small seats or new one need to be careful as things like this can be overlooked. For instance, new developers may create a new web project and not take these precautions into consideration. Therefore, I don’t feel like it's a trusted site. I would always be hesitant to enter sensitive data like entering Credit card info, then tolater find that all your money has been withdrawn. However, I did say bigger companies one wouldn't have to worry about but I do remember an instance when LinkedIn was compromised so anyone who had an account there and used the same authentication was very much hacked.  Luckey at that time I didn’t have an account. Another Form of Web Security that I have personally seen that almost fell victim to was Cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This one concerns me because I feel like many people can fall victim to this as it seems very common if you are not eductioned in this. For instance, I once lost my iPhone, and one day I received an email about my phone being found and to enter my icloud email and password to detect where it was. I was so shocked that it finally showed up on findmyPhone. However, I closely inspected the email as it was not sent from apple and I was almost a victim of giving my own information and control to a hacker. Or better yet I have seen messages of my email being compromised and that I need to act quick and change it. I believe that is another example of CSRF. After reading about the Top 10 Web Application Security Risk it was information to read about the most commonly compromised web security by security misconfiguration. Because one needs to be aware of the enter application stack that also shares sensitive data. As they say your chain is only as good as your weakest link and data is at risk anywhere such as a framework, files, storage, libraries not just in the operating system. One has to alleviate unnecessary features, apply security on libraries, databases, asd servers.And always make sure software is up to date or else it may be vulnerable. An example of a common scenario is cloud services provider has default sharing permissions open to the internet. What TIP of this assignment is that so many security risk factors one needs to consider when developing a web application. In addition, new threats may arrive and one needs to update security and stay informed of new attacks because information is always at risk and  hackers will always try to find a new way to exploit weak applications. </p>
