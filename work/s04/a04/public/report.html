<h2>S01</h2>
<p class="reportPara">I did have prior experience in Git version control; however, I primarily 
    used github GUI or the built in tool inside of intelliJ. So my experience 
    before was not through command line because I tried to avoid it as much as
     possible as I was uneasy about it. But doing this assignment I tried to 
     use the command line more as it was recommended by my instructor and now 
     I believe I’m more comfortable with the command line. So explained before 
     I used github so I am familiar with it; however, it was more with Java 
     and not with markdown as I had no previous experience with markdown. 
     Also this assignment was my first time using Github pages. Speaking of 
     new experiences this was also my first time creating a website. I have 
     never created one before so I can say I don’t have a knowledge of Web 
     development and I’m excited for this course to finally get the chance to 
     acquire the skill that is so prevalent in today's world. Well TIL learned 
     a new development environment Visual Studio Code my choice at the moment 
     for a text editor. I’m becoming more familiar with git command line. 
     Lastly to launch my own website through git pages are all the things I 
     learned during this assignment. </p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p class="reportPara">I have never previously experienced HTML, CSS or JavaScript before this course. Although,
    I'm very aware how widely used the languages are in the Web I have solely been doing Java
    but I am really intrigued to learn it this term. Initially before any previous knowledge
    programming I didn't know that there was a difference between Java and JavaScript, I honestly
    thought it was the same language and maybe people would pronounce it differently. But it is obvious
    now that there is a significant difference.
    While learning more about Web development one can see the roles and importance that HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript has this paradigm. HTML which is known as a hypertext markup language, is in essence partially
    what the name indicates; text, written text that could be content of the webpage in the form of a
    document to be displayed. However, in order for this document on the web to have some visual appeal
    this task can be assisted by Cascading Style Sheets abbreviated as CSS which is responsible for attributes
    such as, background color, layout, visual effects, font size as it focuses more on style than content.
    However, this creates a more static web application or website and in order to develop something more
    dynamically this is where one might consider JavaScript. AS JS is known as a high-level dynamic interpreted
    programming language. Moreover, it allows functions such as, bringing motion and logic to the website.
    As we know HTTP in a hypertext transfer protocol and enables HTML to interact with a web server with
    request-response protocol. The web server will have resources that allows the client to get new resources,
    add, delete, or update just to name a few allowing the website to display dynamic content.
    The thing I learned during this section was the architecture of how files in websites are structured
    in a text editor. Moreover, I'm leaning a great deal about how to navigate and utilize Visual Studio Code to
    develop web page content. In addition, styling in CSS as its still new to me learning how to manipulate
    web page content to look acceptable. I still have a lot to learn at least I'm learning some fundamentals.

<h2>S03</h2>
<p class="reportPara">As I stated in previous assignments it was my first time ever using JavaScript periods; 
            Therefore, during the assignment it was also my first time experiencing working with client 
            side JavaScript since everything is new to me in Web development. The only other language 
            I can compare to with JavaScript is Java since that is the only other programming language 
            that I have used during my studies at the University. Thus, far I can say there are a lot of
            similarities between the two languages. Some of the syntax and structure seems very similar
            and wasn’t so much of a learning curve as data structure seems to be the same and functions
            being called seem to be easy as well. The challenge for me was more about how the files 
            were structured such as how CSS, HTML, and JS files interacted with one another. However,
                once I learned how they all communicated with one another development became a bit easier.
                While working on the coding exercises I just always take a task at a time and depending 
                how much of a challenge the exercise was I would proceed to the next one as once engaged
                it's easier to continue and want to finish the next task. However, If I got stuck for 
                too long then I would decide maybe to move on  or come back to it later.  However, once
                done I would be very pleased with myself with what I had accomplished. But sometimes I
                was uncertain if I had met the criteria of the task. Reading the instructions it seems 
                to me that I had done the exercise correctly but of course there is always room for 
                improvement. Today I learned how to write in Javascript and how they make web pages more
                    dynamic. As I stated before I learned how html, CSS, and JS all come together to create
                    web content. Although I had learned CSS/html on the previous assignment, I found myself
                    to learn much more about how to create elements and style them to more “advance” styles
                    that are not just color and size. I did notice that my page is looking a little bit more
                        like a web page but I can also tell that I still need a lot more practice.

<h2>S04</h2>
<p class="reportPara">During this assignment  I was presented with the task of building a web
    application using Node and Express. This was a surprise to me as my previous knowledge of 
    JavaScript was that it was a front-end language, thus, I didn’t know that JS had a 
    backside-language that could be done on the server-side of an web application. This was my 
    first time using both node.js and express and the only comparable language I could relate it 
    to is Java and that is probably because my arsenal of programming languages are limited to only 
    that. Now that I have been working with Javascript for a few assignments now I’m getting a 
    better understanding of syntax and feeling more confident, however, I can tell I still have l
    ots of room for improvement such things as Node documentation helped out a lot with that. As 
    for Node running and working with command line was still new to me and after the assignments 
    I have found my development in the terminal getting better. The biggest challenge was 
    understanding how to create functions, modules, and classes in files. Since it was a different 
    structure than what I was used to compared to Java. Express seemed very similar to creating
     a RESTFUL API in Java with the same CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. With express I learned 
     how to import and export functions and modules and how to create static resources. The method I
     sed to do the coding assignment was follow the instructions and do each task one at a time in 
     chronological order to have a good understanding. The instructions were pretty clear to 
     comprehend if I ran into a problem I would resort to googling the question in order to 
     overcome the problem I had. This method would work all the time as googling stuff doesn’t 
     always have the direct answer, sometimes it would take a few attempts but ultimately would 
     work. I aimed to get a 4 but at times I could find myself getting stuck and I found the task 
     challenging . The lesson I learned during the assignment was the obvious working with NOde.js 
     and Express such as creating classes, functions, and modules. In addition how to import and
      export these things from one file to another when needed.
