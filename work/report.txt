I did have prior experience in Git version control; however, I primarily 
used github GUI or the built in tool inside of intelliJ. So my experience 
before was not through command line because I tried to avoid it as much as
 possible as I was uneasy about it. But doing this assignment I tried to 
 use the command line more as it was recommended by my instructor and now 
 I believe I’m more comfortable with the command line. So explained before 
 I used github so I am familiar with it; however, it was more with Java 
 and not with markdown as I had no previous experience with markdown. 
 Also this assignment was my first time using Github pages. Speaking of 
 new experiences this was also my first time creating a website. I have 
 never created one before so I can say I don’t have a knowledge of Web 
 development and I’m excited for this course to finally get the chance to 
 acquire the skill that is so prevalent in today's world. Well TIL learned 
 a new development environment Visual Studio Code my choice at the moment 
 for a text editor. I’m becoming more familiar with git command line. 
 Lastly to launch my own website through git pages are all the things I 
 learned during this assignment.
